    "bio": "I watch tons of movies, I play action & adventure videogames, and I love to experience new adventures with my girlfriend. I'm also currently saving to invest in my real-estate deal. \nFrom basic puzzles to advanced math, I have always had an immense fascination to solve problems. When I was introduced to computer science in high school, it seemed natural, and I loved it! Today I feel an obligation to imaginatively contribute technology that world can use.",
